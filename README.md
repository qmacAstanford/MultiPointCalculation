The file with the same name except for different extensions (.py vs .ipynb)
stand for the same code.  The documentations is in the ipynb while you can
import the .py file.

## MultiPoint
This does the 2,3, and 4 point intigrals over propagators.
See Example.ipynb for how to use.
This imports special.py which are just some usefull functions.

## WLCgreen
This calculates the eigenvalues, residue, and the like for the worm like chain
